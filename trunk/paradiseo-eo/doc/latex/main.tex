\section{Introduction}\label{main_intro}
{\bf EO}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{class_e_o})} is a templates-based, ANSI-C++ compliant evolutionary computation library. It contains classes for almost any kind of evolutionary computation you might come up to - at least for the ones we could think of. It is component-based, so that if you don't find the class you need in it, it is very easy to subclass existing abstract or concrete classes.\section{Tutorial}\label{main_tutorial}
The best place to learn about the features and approaches of {\bf EO}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{class_e_o})} is to look at the {\tt tutorial}.\section{Installation}\label{main_install}
The installation procedure of the package is detailed in the {\tt README} file in the top-directory of the source-tree.\section{Overall Design}\label{main_design}
For an introduction to the design of {\bf EO}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{class_e_o})} you can look at the {\tt slides} from a talk at EA 2001 or the corresponding {\tt article} in {\tt {\em Lecture Notes In Computer Science\/} {\bf 2310}, {\em Selected Papers from the 5th European Conference on Artificial Evolution\/}}.
