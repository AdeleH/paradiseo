.SS "template<class BinaryFunctor> class eoBinaryFunctorCounter< BinaryFunctor >"
Generic counter class that counts the number of times a binary function is used. 

Add a binary function through its ctor and use this class instead of it.
.PP
It is derived from \fBeoValueParam\fP so you can add it to a monitor.

.PP
Calls the embedded function and increments the counter. 
.PP
Note for MSVC users, if this code does not compile, you are quite likely trying to count a function that has a non-void return type. Don't look at us, look at the MSVC builders. Code like 'return void;' is perfectly legal according to the ANSI standard, but the guys at Microsoft didn't get to implementing it yet.
.PP
We had two choices: assuming (and compiling ) code that returns void or code that returns non-void. Given that in \fBEO\fP most functors return void, it was chosen to support void.
.PP
But also please let me know if you have a compiler that defines _MSC_VER (lot's of windows compilers do), but is quite capable of compiling return void; type of code. We'll try to change the signature then.
.PP
You happy GNU (and other compiler) users will not have a problem with this.
