\section{Introduction}\label{main_intro}
Paradis\-EO-MOEO is a white-box object-oriented generic framework dedicated to the flexible design of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms. This paradigm-free software embeds some features and techniques for Pareto-based resolution and aims to provide a set of classes allowing to ease and speed up the development of computationally efficient programs. It is based on a clear conceptual distinction between the solution methods and the multi-objective problems they are intended to solve. This separation confers a maximum design and code reuse. Paradis\-EO-MOEO provides a broad range of archive-related features (such as elitism or performance metrics) and the most common Pareto-based fitness assignment strategies (MOGA, NSGA, SPEA, IBEA and more). Furthermore, parallel and distributed models as well as hybridization mechanisms can be applied to an algorithm designed within Paradis\-EO-MOEO using the whole version of Paradis\-EO.\section{Tutorial}\label{main_tutorial}
A tutorial about a bi-objective flow-shop scheduling problem will be available soon.\section{Installation}\label{main_install}
The installation procedure of the package is detailed in the {\tt README} file in the top-directory of the source-tree.\section{Overall Design}\label{main_design}
For an introduction to the design of Paradis\-EO-MOEO, you can look at the {\tt Paradis\-EO website}.
