eo\-Merge: Base class for elitist replacement algorithms. 

Merges the old population (first argument), with the new generation

Its signature is exactly that of the selection base {\bf eo\-Select}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{classeo_select})}, but its purpose is to merge the two populations into one (the second argument). Note that the algorithms assume that the second argument denotes the next generation.
