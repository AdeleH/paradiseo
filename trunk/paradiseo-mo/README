Welcome to PARADISEO-MO (Moving Objects), one of the extension of Evolving Objects library.

==================================================================
                      BUILDING MO
==================================================================
The basic installation procedure goes the following:

Go to your build-directory and run 
    $(SRCDIR)/configure
    make
    make doc

where $(SRCDIR) is the top-level source directory of EO, i.e. where
the sources where unpacked.

In case of problems, you can read the INSTALL file - but remember this
is a standard installation file from GNU and that it contains nothing
specific about MO.

To clean everything, in the simply run 
    make clean_all
