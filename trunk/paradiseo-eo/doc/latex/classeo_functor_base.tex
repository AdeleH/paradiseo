\subsection{Detailed Description}
Base class for functors to get a nice hierarchy diagram. 

That's actually quite an understatement as it does quite a bit more than just that. By having all functors derive from the same base class, we can do some memory management that would otherwise be very hard.

The memory management base class is called {\bf eo\-Functor\-Store}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{classeo_functor_store})}, and it supports a member add() to add a pointer to a functor. When the functor\-Store is destroyed, it will delete all those pointers. So beware: do not delete the functor\-Store before you are done with anything that might have been allocated.
