/** @mainpage Welcome to ParadisEO-MOEO

@section intro Introduction

ParadisEO-MOEO is a white-box object-oriented generic framework dedicated to the flexible design of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms.
This paradigm-free software embeds some features and techniques for Pareto-based resolution and 
aims to provide a set of classes allowing to ease and speed up the development of computationally efficient programs.
It is based on a clear conceptual distinction between the solution methods and the multi-objective problems they are intended to solve. 
This separation confers a maximum design and code reuse.
ParadisEO-MOEO provides a broad range of archive-related features (such as elitism or performance metrics) 
and the most common Pareto-based fitness assignment strategies (MOGA, NSGA, SPEA, IBEA and more).
Furthermore, parallel and distributed models as well as hybridization mechanisms can be applied to an algorithm designed within ParadisEO-MOEO
using the whole version of ParadisEO.
