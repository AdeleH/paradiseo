.SS "template<class EOT> class eoAlgo< EOT >"
This is a generic class for population-transforming algorithms. 

There is only one operator defined, which takes a population and does stuff to it. It needn't be a complete algorithm, can be also a step of an algorithm. This class just gives a common interface to linear population-transforming algorithms.
