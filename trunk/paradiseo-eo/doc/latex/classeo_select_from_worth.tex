\subsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$class EOT, class Worth\-Type = double$>$ class eo\-Select\-From\-Worth$<$ EOT, Worth\-Type $>$}

selects one element from a population (is an {\bf eo\-Select\-One}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{classeo_select_one})}) but the selection is based on a std::vector of Worth that is different from the fitnesses (e.g. 

{\bf EO}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{class_e_o})} fitness is what Koza terms \char`\"{}raw fitness\char`\"{}, Worth is what the selection is based upon).

see class {\bf eo\-Perf2Worth}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{classeo_perf2_worth})}: an {\bf eo\-Stat}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{classeo_stat})} that transforms fitnesses into Worthes

Note: Worthes will not always be doubles - see some multi-objective techniques where it is a std::pair of doubles ...

It has to have a $<$ operator it you want to call an existing selector (see selector.h) - but of course you can write the whole thing ...
